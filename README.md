# Stat-Models

This repo contains r code for statistical models that I have gathered from various sources. I have pulled heavily from the following sources.
1. Data Camp www.datacamp.com
2. Dr. Andy Field's book, Discovering Statistics Using R. https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067
