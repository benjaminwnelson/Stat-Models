# Stat-Models

This repo contains r code for statistical models that I have gathered from various sources. I have pulled heavily from the following sources:
1. Data Camp www.datacamp.com
2. Discovering Statistics Using R by Dr. Andy Field https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067

I cannot recommend these resources highly enough.
